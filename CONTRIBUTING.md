If you are reading this, you are propably thinking about contributing to this repo, and therefore I sincerely thank you!
To make this as readable as possible I'll try to keep it short and structured so you can dive right in!

Here is a short list of what I generally require from contributors:

## General 
- Use the [PEP8 Styleguide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- Write [Clean Code](https://gist.github.com/wojteklu/73c6914cc446146b8b533c0988cf8d29)
- Try to maintain the already given structure of the source
- If you have any suggestions, feel free to make an issue! We can discuss it there!
- If you have questions, write me an Email or comment under the issue! That's the fastest way to get in touch

## Issues
If you create an issue with the intent of having someone else solve it, please be as precise as you can!
For follow-up issues or ones that you create on your own, describe why the issue is necessarry for the person reviewing it!

## Branches
Use a seperate branch for your issues! Always [squash](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/wiki/Using-git-to-prepare-your-PR-to-have-a-clean-history) the commits to a single one at the end and use a [clean commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
